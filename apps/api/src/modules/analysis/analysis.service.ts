      const prompt = `You are analyzing a video to extract key scenes for recreating an 8-second viral video using AI video generation tools.
Focus ONLY on the most impactful, engaging moments. Ignore filler, transitions, credits, or non-essential content. Prioritize intensity, visual impact, and message clarity.

You must respond with a valid JSON object with a single key "sceneBreakdown" containing the scene breakdown, like so:
{
  "sceneBreakdown": ""
}

For each scene, provide:
SCENE BREAKDOWN:
[Timestamp from original video]
Duration: [seconds needed in 8-sec format]
Scene Purpose: [Hook/Problem/Solution/CTA]
Visual Details:
Camera angle and movement: [specific framing and any dolly, pan, or zoom]
Subject positioning and action: [what's happening, who/what is visible, direction of movement]
Lighting: [dominant color temperature, intensity, shadows, mood]
Color palette: [primary colors, grading, emotional tone]
On-screen elements: [text, graphics, overlays, props visible]
Visual effects or transitions: [any special effects, cuts, or stylistic elements]
Cinematic Details:
Shot type: [wide, medium, close-up, detail shot]
Pacing/rhythm: [speed of action, cut timing]
Style and aesthetic: [documentary, cinematic, animated, product demo, etc.]
Audio Details:
Dialogue/voiceover: [exact words if present, tone, emotional delivery]
Sound design: [music genre, ambient sounds, sound effects, music intensity]
Timing: [when sounds occur relative to visuals]

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
Maintain the original video's core message and visual identity.
Optimize for maximum virality: emotional impact, pattern interrupts, clarity, and urgency.
Respond with a valid JSON with 1 key "sceneBreakdown", without any additional explanation or text outside the JSON object.`;
